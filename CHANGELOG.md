## NOT RELEASED - 2019-07-16
#### Added
* AWS Celeb
  * gm_celeb_detection_enabled - Whether or not celeb detection is enabled

```
module "platform" {
  ...
  # (Optional) AWS Celeberty detection
  gm_celeb_detection_enabled  = true
  gm_celeb_detection_interval = "5m"
  ...
}
```
  
* Added ML Technical Cues extractor.  This new api will be replacing credits extractor cluster.
```
# tcues - (Optional) Technical Cues extractor.
module "tcues" {
  source = "github.com/graymeta/terraform-aws-platform//modules/ml_services/tcues?ref=v0.1.10"

  instance_type          = "m5.large"
  max_cluster_size       = "2"
  min_cluster_size       = "1"
  ml_loadbalancer_output = "${module.ml_network.ml_loadbalancer_output}"

}

output "tcues_endpoint" {
  value = "${module.tcues.endpoint}"
}
```

#### Removed

  ...
}

output "credits_endpoint" {
  ...
}

  * `account_lockout_attempts` - The number of failed login attempts that will trigger an account lockout. Default: 5
  * `account_lockout_interval` - The amount of time an account is locked out after exceeding the threshold for number of failed logins. Default: 10m.  Valid values must be parseable as a Golang [time.Duration](https://godoc.org/time#ParseDuration)

      dropbox_app_secret = "your Dropbox application secret"
      ...
    }
```

## [v0.1.0] - 2018-10-24
**Upgrading to this release will cause an outage while the proxy cluster is created, and Services and ECS instances are recreate.**

#### Added
* Two new subnets for proxy instances in the network module.  You need to apply only if the default value for vpc_cidr was not used.
```
    module "network" {
      ...
      cidr_subnet_proxy_1 = "10.0.20.0/24"
      cidr_subnet_proxy_2 = "10.0.21.0/24"
      ...
    }
```
   
* Added a Proxy cluster in the network module.  All routes from other subnets to NAT gateway have been removed.  This will create a new internal loadbalancer with proxy instances.  All outbound api requests are now locked down by the proxy cluster.  The autoscaling thresholds should be adjusted for the instance type.
```
    module "network" {
      ...
      # Proxy Cluster
      dns_name               = "foo.cust.graymeta.com"
      key_name               = "${local.key_name}"
      log_retention          = "7"
      proxy_instance_type    = "m4.large"
      proxy_max_cluster_size = 4
      proxy_min_cluster_size = 2
      proxy_scale_down_thres = "12500000" # bytes = 100 Mb/s
      proxy_scale_up_thres   = "50000000" # bytes = 400 Mb/s
      ssh_cidr_blocks        = "10.0.0.0/24,10.0.1.0/24"
      ...
    }
```
   
* Add the Proxy endpoint variable to the platform module.
```
    module "platform" {
      ...
      proxy_endpoint = "${module.network.proxy_endpoint}"
      ...
    }
```

* (Optional) Added Credits to the Faces cluster.  To setup the extractor in the UI you need the credits endpoint.  In the UI go to Settings -> Extractors -> Credits.  Then insert the output from credits_endpoint in the Hostname field.
```
    output "credits_endpoint" {
        value = "${module.faces.credit_endpoint}"
    }
```
  
* (Optional) Added Slates to the Faces cluster.  To setup the extractor in the UI you need the slates endpoint.  In the UI go to Settings -> Extractors -> Slates.  Then insert the output from slates_endpoint in the Hostname field.
```
    output "slates_endpoint" {
        value = "${module.faces.slates_endpoint}"
    }
```
  
#### Changed
* Now creating ECS nodes in two AZ.  Network Module we renamed the `cidr_subnet_ecs` subnet to `cidr_subnet_ecs_1` and added a `cidr_subnet_ecs_2`.  Recommended that cidr_subnet_ecs_2 to be a /21 subnet.  You need to apply only if the default value for vpc_cidr was not used.
```
    module "network" {
      ...
      cidr_subnet_ecs_1 = "10.0.8.0/21"
      cidr_subnet_ecs_2 = "10.0.24.0/21"
      ...
    }
```
  
* Now creating ECS nodes in two AZ.  In the Platform module rename `ecs_subnet_id` variable to `ecs_subnet_id_1`.  Then add the `ecs_subnet_id_2` variable.
```
    module "platform" {
      ...
      ecs_subnet_id_1 = "${module.network.ecs_subnet_id_1}"
      ecs_subnet_id_2 = "${module.network.ecs_subnet_id_2}"
      ...
    }
```
  
* Renamed the ElastiCache instance so multiple platforms in the same region can be supported.

* Platform AMI update to version 2.0.2472.  Contact GrayMeta for more details

#### Removed
* Removed facebox from the platform module.  Please delete the following variables.
```
    module "platform" {
      ...
      elasticache_instance_type_facebox  = "cache.m4.large"
      facebox_key = ""
      ...
    }
```

## [v0.0.32] - 2018-09-17
#### Added
* Added variable for the RDS backup retention and window within the platform module.  The default retention is now set to 7 days and a backup window set to 03:00-04:00.  Previous versions this was not set.  This will create a pending update for the next maintenance window.
```
    module "platform" {
      source = "github.com/graymeta/terraform-aws-platform?ref=v0.0.32"
      ...
      db_backup_retention = "7"
      db_backup_window    = "03:00-04:00"
      ...
    }
```

* Added variable to set the RDS as a multi_az.  Default is now set to true.  Previous versions this was not set.  This will create a pending update for the next maintenance window.
```
    module "platform" {
      source = "github.com/graymeta/terraform-aws-platform?ref=v0.0.32"
      ...
      db_multi_az = true
      ...
    }
```
  
* Added two new subnets for faces in the network module.  You need to apply only if the default value for vpc_cidr was not used.
```
    module "network" {
      source = "github.com/graymeta/terraform-aws-platform//modules/network?ref=v0.0.32"
      ...
      cidr_subnet_faces_1 = "x.x.x.x/24"
      cidr_subnet_faces_2 = "x.x.x.x/24"
      ...
    }
```
  
* (Optional) Added Faces module.  More info at [README-faces](README-faces.md)
  
#### Changed
* Install 1 NAT Gateway in each AZ instead of one for Services and the other for ECS.  It is required to change the following two variable names in the platform module.  
```
    ecs_nat_ip      => az1_nat_ip
    services_nat_ip => az2_nat_ip
```

## [v0.0.31] - 2018-09-06  
#### Added
* (Optional) Added service and ecs cloud init settings.  These cloud-init's will be merged with GrayMeta cloud-init script.  Please check with GrayMeta support to verify your cloud-init scripts will not interfere with the defaults.
```
    module "platform" {
      source = "github.com/graymeta/terraform-aws-platform?ref=v0.0.31"
      ...
      services_user_init = "${data.template_file.service_data.rendered}"
      ecs_user_init      = "${data.template_file.ecs_data.rendered}"
      ...
    }
```
  
#### Removed

* Consolidated Redis environment variables on the backend of the service instances.  No template changes needed.
* Removed the Box.com variables since they are now configured in the UI.  Please remove if you have the following in the platform module.

```
    # Box (Box.com)
    box_client_id                    = ""
    box_client_secret                = ""
