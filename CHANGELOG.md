All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [NOT RELEASED] - <date>
#### Added
- Added two new subnets for proxy instances in the network module.  If you did not use the default value for vpc_cidr then you need to add two new subnets.
```
module "network" {
  source = "github.com/graymeta/terraform-aws-platform//modules/network?ref=v0.0.33"
  ...
  cidr_subnet_proxy_1 = "10.0.20.0/24"
  cidr_subnet_proxy_2 = "10.0.21.0/24"
  ...
}
```
  
#### Changed
- Now creating ECS nodes in two AZ.  Network Module we renamed the `cidr_subnet_ecs` subnet to `cidr_subnet_ecs_1` and added a `cidr_subnet_ecs_2`.  Recommened that cidr_subnet_ecs_2 to be a /21 subnet.  The default values in example:
```
module "network" {
  source = "github.com/graymeta/terraform-aws-platform//modules/network?ref=v0.0.33"
  ...
  cidr_subnet_ecs_1 = "10.0.8.0/21"
  cidr_subnet_ecs_2 = "10.0.24.0/21"
  ...
```
  
- Now creating ECS nodes in two AZ.  In the Platform module rename `ecs_subnet_id` variable to `ecs_subnet_id_1`.  Then add the `ecs_subnet_id_2` variable.  Example:
```
module "platform" {
  source = "github.com/graymeta/terraform-aws-platform?ref=v0.0.33"
  ...
  ecs_subnet_id_1 = "${module.network.ecs_subnet_id_1}"
  ecs_subnet_id_2 = "${module.network.ecs_subnet_id_2}"
  ...
}
```

#### Removed
- Removed facebox_key from the platform module.

   
## [v0.0.32] - 2018-09-17
#### Added
- Added variable for the RDS backup retention and window within the platform module.  The default retention is now set to 7 days and a backup window set to 03:00-04:00.  Previous versions this was not set.  This will create a pending update for the next maintance window.
```
module "platform" {
  source = "github.com/graymeta/terraform-aws-platform?ref=v0.0.32"
  ...
  db_backup_retention = "7"
  db_backup_window    = "03:00-04:00"
  ...
}
```

- Added variable to set the RDS as a multi_az.  Default is now set to true.  Previous versions this was not set.  This will create a pending update for the next maintance window.
```
module "platform" {
  source = "github.com/graymeta/terraform-aws-platform?ref=v0.0.32"
  ...
  db_multi_az = true
  ...
}
```
  
- Added two new subnets for faces in the network module.  If you did not use the default value for vpc_cidr then you need to add two new subnets.
```
module "network" {
  source = "github.com/graymeta/terraform-aws-platform//modules/network?ref=v0.0.32"
  ...
  cidr_subnet_faces_1 = "x.x.x.x/24"
  cidr_subnet_faces_2 = "x.x.x.x/24"
  ...
}
```
  
- (Optional) Added Faces module.  More info at [README-faces](README-faces.md)
  
#### Changed
- Install 1 NAT Gateway in each AZ instead of one for Services and the other for ECS.  It is required to change the following two variable names in the platform module.  
```
        ecs_nat_ip      => az1_nat_ip
        services_nat_ip => az2_nat_ip
```
  
- Platform AMI update to verision 2.0.2339.  Contact Graymeta for more details

## [v0.0.31] - 2018-09-06  
#### Added
- (Optional) Added service and ecs cloud init settings.  These cloud-init's will be merged with Graymeta cloud-init script.  Please check with Graymeta support to verify your cloud-init scripts will not interfere with the defaults.
```
module "platform" {
  source = "github.com/graymeta/terraform-aws-platform?ref=v0.0.31"
  ...
  services_user_init = "${data.template_file.service_data.rendered}"
  ecs_user_init      = "${data.template_file.ecs_data.rendered}"
  ...
}
```
  
#### Removed
- Consolidated Redis environment variables on the backend of the service instances.  No template changes needed.
- Removed the Box.com variables since they are now configured in the UI.  If you have the following in the platform module please remove
```
    # Box (Box.com)
    box_client_id                    = ""
    box_client_secret                = ""
```
