All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [NOT_RELEASE] - date
#### Added
- Added two new subnets for faces in the network module.  If you did not use the default value for vpc_cidr then you need to add two new networks.
```
module "network" {
  source = "github.com/graymeta/terraform-aws-platform//modules/network?ref=v0.0.32"
  ...
  cidr_subnet_faces_1 = "x.x.x.x/24"
  cidr_subnet_faces_2 = "x.x.x.x/24"
  ...
}
```
  
- (Optional) Added Faces IAM module and Faces Cluser module.  More info at [README-faces](README-faces.md)



#### Changed
- Install 1 NAT Gateway in each AZ instead of one for Services and the other for ECS.  It is required to change the following two variable names in the platform module.  
```
        ecs_nat_ip      => az1_nat_ip
        services_nat_ip => az2_nat_ip
```

## [v0.0.31] - 2018-09-06  
#### Added
- (Optional) Added service and ecs cloud init settings.  These cloud-init's will be merged with Graymeta cloud-init script.  Please check with Graymeta support to verify your cloud-init scripts will not interfere with the defaults.
```
module "platform" {
  source = "github.com/graymeta/terraform-aws-platform?ref=v0.0.31"
  ...
  services_user_init = "${data.template_file.service_data.rendered}"
  ecs_user_init      = "${data.template_file.ecs_data.rendered}"
  ...
}
```
  
#### Removed
- Consolidated Redis environment variables on the backend of the service instances.  No template changes needed.
- Removed the Box.com variables since they are now configured in the UI.  If you have the following in the platform module please remove
```
    # Box (Box.com)
    box_client_id                    = ""
    box_client_secret                = ""
```
